

I use the act of painting as a tool of visual organization. 
My current work stages fictional scenes and scenarios existing within
nonfictional spaces in order to represent ideas from personal experience,
to understand and to show my perspective as a part of a larger whole. 
The way in which I reconstruct my surroundings is an attempt
to gain insight into the world around me and how I fit into it. 
I work towards finding and displaying aspects of experience 
that are more universal by looking for patterns 
and distilling those down into single moments. 
A still image allows the viewer to have the time necessary 
to absorb all the details that would be overlooked in the moment,
and process the complex and intricate reality we exist within.
